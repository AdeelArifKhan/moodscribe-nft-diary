# MoodScribe - Emotion NFT Diary

AI-powered diary that converts your emotions into short stories and AI-generated art, then mints it as an NFT on Solana.

MoodScribe is a modern web application designed to help users record their daily moods and emotions. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive digital diary that allows users not only to write about their feelings but also to visualize their emotions, helping them better understand and manage their mental and emotional well-being.

Here's why it fits the AI / Wellbeing category:
ðŸ’¬ Emotion Tracking & Mood Recognition:
It helps users track and reflect on their emotions â€” a core concept in emotional AI and mental health tech.

ðŸ§˜ Mental Wellbeing Focus:
It's designed to improve awareness of one's emotional state, supporting digital mental health and self-care.

ðŸ“± Smart Diary Concept:
The emoji-based, interactive diary gives a modern twist on traditional journaling, aligning with AI-enhanced self-reflection tools.

Why is this project needed?
In todayâ€™s fast-paced life, many people struggle to recognize and control their emotions and stress levels. A digital mood diary serves as a helpful tool for individuals to track their daily moods and monitor their mental health. It is especially useful for those who want to use digital tools to better understand and manage their feelings.
How does the project work?
User Interaction: Users select their mood for the day and can add notes or thoughts alongside it.

Mood Visualization: Each mood is represented by a unique emoji or icon, visually expressing the userâ€™s diary entry.

Record Keeping: All entries are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring data is preserved and easily accessible to the user.

Responsive Design: Using Tailwind CSS, the app looks good and works smoothly across all devicesâ€”mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Benefits of this project
Mental Health Awareness: By recording moods daily, users can recognize emotional patterns and track stress or anxiety, enabling better personal decisions.

Privacy: Data is stored only in the userâ€™s browser local storage, maintaining full privacy.

User-friendly Interface: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the app provides a fast, interactive, and easy-to-use experience.
